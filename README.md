# NU_453_NLP

The sotu_corpus_small.csv file contains 101 speeches and does not have any of the cell breaks. Please use this one for the project.

### Project Scope

The project design is to utilize NLP techniques to preform data mining, determine term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) estimations, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis of 101 State of the Union addresses from 1791 to 2019. 

### Desired Outcome

Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, TF-IDF and LDA values to derive deeper insights of American politics through the centuries and deepen understanding of NLP processes and results.

### Corpus Development

Corpus is to be developed from SOTU addresses published to the State of the Union website. A scoped down assortment of all 243 files was used for speed and simplicity. 

### Model

The NLP modeling will incorporate a variety of scripts and/or Jupyter notebooks from the MSDS 453 Winter 2019 course, those discovered on GitHub, and the SOTU Kaggle website.
